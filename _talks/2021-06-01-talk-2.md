Thermal sensors are essential for developing face recognition systems that can
operate in low-light and nighttime environments, as well as detecting presentation attacks such
as 3D mask and makeup. In this talk, I will showcase two approaches that have been developed
to address thermal-to-visible face matching: SG-GAN, in which we embed the semantic
information to better preserve the shape; and LG-GAN, a latent-guided generative adversarial
network that offers useful insights on interpreting and explaining thermal-to-visible face image
translation. I will also describe potential applications of utilizing thermal sensors for face
presentation attack detection and identify key challenges for future thermal-to-visible face
recognition technologies.
